# cn-json
Cond√© Nast JSON option 1 article task
JSON must be served on a web server so I used my localhost MAMP.
The root index.html file displays each article title, body, and cover image in a table format.
Plaintext are in black, h2's are red and bold, and pull quotes are grey and italic.
Furthermore, clicking on each article cover image should take you to its reference url link where the cover image is also displayed.
